# FDL-Koila

Example using https://github.com/rentruewang/koila package.

Run the notebook to (not) see koila in action. You can change the params in the first cell - whether to activate koila or not; whether to use a resnet or a generic FC net; you can also try changing fc_hidden to `8000` and the FC Net will run without OOM with/without koila (on a 32GB VRAM machine).
